This analysis document accompanies a manuscript that reports analysis of microbial communities sampled from smartphone touchscreens, as well as the index fingers and thumbs of their owners. This was a project that was conducted as an educational workshop meant to explore innovative ways to monitor health. The manuscript is currently in review. This document was produced with the [`knitr` package](http://yihui.name/knitr/) in R, and all source code can be found on GitHub: [https://github.com/jfmeadow/Meadow_etal_Phones](https://github.com/jfmeadow/Meadow_etal_Phones)
